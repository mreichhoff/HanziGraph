### Android TWA

This directory was mostly generated by [bubblewrap](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap).

It is a [TWA](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/quick-start), not
meaningfully different than being installed as a PWA, but allowing Play Store distribution*.

An initial version of HanziGraph-as-app will be built that way.

A true native version (on both Android and iOS) remains desired; this is a first step.

*if I manage to find 12 testers or whatever...

        <p>This site is a prototype, but it&#39;s decently usable in its current state. Feel free to see the (currently
            at a
            hackathon level of quality) <a href="https://github.com/mreichhoff/HanziGraph">code</a> or contact <a
                href="https://github.com/mreichhoff">the author on github</a>.</p>
        <p>The idea is to emphasize the word-forming connections among hanzi to help learners remember them. I&#39;ve
            found
            this more fun and effective than other methods, like studying stroke order, learning radicals or components,
            writing each character out 100 times, or doing spaced repetition on cards mapping hanzi to pinyin and
            English.

            <li>Is there an app?<ul>
                    <li>The site is a progressive web app. This means it uses modern browser APIs to make an installable
                        app. Follow <a

                            directions for your platform</a> to install it. A truly native app downloadable from the app
                        stores may be a future work item.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Where did the examples come from?<ul>
                    <li>The examples came from <a href="https://tatoeba.org">Tatoeba</a>, which releases data under <a
                            href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/fr">CC-BY 2.0 FR</a>, and from <a

                    <li>Definitions and pinyin transcriptions of individual words were pulled from <a
                            href="https://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php">CEDICT</a>, which releases data under <a

        <ul>
            <li>Why are the examples for certain characters a little strange?<ul>
                    <li>Some characters are not commonly used alone. The examples use a process called <a
                            href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html">tokenization</a>
                        to
                        split the sentences into individual words. For example, 他是非常好 might be split into words like: 他,
                        是,
                        非常, 好. Future updates might show any sentences that contain the character, even if it&#39;s used
                        as
                        part of another word.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Why doesn&#39;t this look good on my smartphone?<ul>
                    <li>Making it look better is in my TODO list.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What if two hanzi can be connected more than one way, like 故事 and 事故?<ul>
                    <li>Clicking the edge that connects them will show examples for both words.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Which characters are present in the graph?<ul>
                    <li>All of the HSK 1-6 characters should be present, and most have examples. <a

            <li>How does this work?<ul>
                    <li>When you add words to your study list, they will be presented to you as flashcards. You&#39;ll
                        be
                        shown the sentence and asked what it means; click &quot;Show Answer&quot; to see how tatoeba
                        translated it. When you click &quot;I didn&#39;t know that&quot;, the card will be added back to
                        the
                        end of your to-study list. When you click &quot;I knew that!&quot;, it will be shown one day
                        later,
                        then two days if you get it right again, then four, and so on. It is meant to be a very, very
                        basic

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What does the export button do?<ul>
                    <li>The export button downloads a file that can be imported into a different (better) spaced
                        repetition
                        system, like Anki.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What happens when I click a hanzi in study mode?<ul>
                    <li>The graph will be updated to show the hanzi you clicked and its connections. The explore panel
                        is
                        also updated. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What happens when I click an edge in study mode?<ul>
                    <li>If you click an edge, the examples are updated and you&#39;ll be brought back to the explore
                        tab.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Where are the flashcards stored?<ul>
                    <li>When you are not signed in: all data for the site is stored in <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>.
                        It
                        does not leave your browser, and clearing your browser data will clear it.</li>
                    <li>When you are signed in: the data is stored on our backend, and should be present and up-to-date
                        on
                        any device. If you add flashcards while signed out, then sign in or register later, the two
                        lists
                        will be merged, so you shouldn&#39;t lose anything.</li>

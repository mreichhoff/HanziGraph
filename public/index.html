                <p>The idea is to emphasize the word-forming connections among hanzi to help learners remember them.

                    found
                    this more fun and effective than other methods, like studying stroke order, learning radicals or
                    components,
                    writing each character out 100 times, or doing spaced repetition on cards mapping hanzi to
                    pinyin

                                like: 他,

                                recommend you visit 中, since 中午 is common, and you&#39;ve seen 午 in several
                                contexts,
                                which might make it easier to remember 中.

            <p>This site is a prototype, but it&#39;s decently usable in its current state. Feel free to see the

                at a

            <p>The idea is to emphasize the word-forming connections among hanzi to help learners remember them.
                I&#39;ve
                found
                this more fun and effective than other methods, like studying stroke order, learning radicals or
                components,
                writing each character out 100 times, or doing spaced repetition on cards mapping hanzi to
                pinyin
                and
                English.

            <h3>Is there an app?</h3>
            <p>
                The site is a progressive web app. This means it uses modern browser APIs to make an
                installable
                app. Follow <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Installing">the
                    directions for your platform</a> to install it. A truly native app downloadable
                from
                the app
                stores may be a future work item.
            </p>
            <h3>Where did the examples come from?</h3>
            <p>
                The examples came from <a href="https://tatoeba.org">Tatoeba</a>, which releases
                data
                under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/fr">CC-BY 2.0 FR</a>, and
                from <a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/">OpenSubtitles</a>, pulled from <a
                    href="https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles2018.php">opus.nlpl.eu</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Definitions and pinyin transcriptions of individual words were pulled from <a
                    href="https://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php">CEDICT</a>, which releases data
                under
                <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.
                Accordingly,
                some of the files in <code>data</code> should be considered released under that same
                license.
            </p>
            <h3>Which characters are present in the graph?</h3>
            <p>
                That depends on which character set you choose. The simplified and traditional choices
                should include everything present in <a href="https://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php">CEDICT</a>.
                Cantonese should also include everything in the CC-Canto project.
                The HSK set should have all the old HSK 2.0 words and characters.

            <h3>How does study mode work?</h3>
            <p>When you add words to your study list, they will be presented to you as flashcards.
                You&#39;ll
                be
                shown the sentence and asked what it means; click &quot;Show Answer&quot; to see how
                tatoeba
                translated it. When you click &quot;I didn&#39;t know that&quot;, the card will be
                added
                back to
                the
                end of your to-study list. When you click &quot;I knew that!&quot;, it will be shown
                one
                day
                later,
                then two days if you get it right again, then four, and so on. It is meant to be a
                very,
                very
                basic
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition
                    system</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>What does the export button do?</h3>
            <p>
                The export button downloads a file that can be imported into a different (better)
                spaced
                repetition
                system, like Anki.
            </p>
            <h3>Where are the flashcards stored?</h3>
            <p>If you are signed in, the data is stored on our servers, and synced across any other device where you
                sign in.
                If you are not signed in, all data for the site is stored in <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>.
                It
                does not leave your browser, and clearing your browser data will clear it.

            <h3>What does "You've seen" mean?</h3>
            <p>As you search, click, or tap hanzi or connections in the diagram, you are shown
                example
                sentences. Then, when you add words to your study list, the examples are converted
                to
                flashcards.
            </p>
            <p>
                This section indicates how many times you've
                viewed examples for each of the characters in a given word, and how many cards
                contain
                those characters. The numbers are based on how things were when you viewed the
                examples,
                so if it's your first time seeing examples for a character, it'll say seen 0 times.
            </p>
            <h3>What do the word frequency and character frequency stats mean?</h3>
            <p>
                In most languages, there are some words that are used much more frequently than others. If you
                learn those words first, you'll be able to understand more of what you hear and read than if you'd start
                with less-common words. With Chinese, the same is true of characters: the most common ones are
                used an outsize proportion of the time, and they are the best ones to start with.
            </p>
            <p>
                HanziGraph tries to help learners know how important a word is via color-coding in the diagrams
                and by surfacing raw frequency stats alongside the definitions and examples. This way,
                learners can concentrate on words that provide the biggest 'bang for your buck', so to speak.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both word and character frequency data is based on analysis of millions of lines of subtitles, wikipedia
                articles, UN declarations, and website text. Particularly for words, the subtitles are given priority,
                since they tend to be more colloquial.

        <section id="faq-flow" style="display:none">
            <h3>What is the flow diagram?</h3>
            <p>
                The flow diagrams are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey diagrams</a>.
                They were generated by analyzing which words are most commonly used before and after the search term.
                Specifically, the top <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation">collocations</a> of length
                2 and 3 are shown. You can read the diagram itself from left to right, with taller bars meaning a
                word was more commonly used. The analysis was done on movie and TV subtitles, so (in theory) the
                diagram represents colloquial speech. You can click any of the words to see examples for it, much
                like the graph diagram.

                The <span class="emphasized-but-not-that-emphasized">source</span> of each sentence is shown.
                <span class="emphasized-but-not-that-emphasized">Human-written</span> sentences are greatly preferred,
                so most sentences come from <a href="https://tatoeba.org" class="active-link">Tatoeba</a>.
                OpenAI's <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> model, plus the <a class="active-link"

                on <a class="active-link" href="https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles2018.php">Opus</a>, were used to fill
                in the gaps.
                We're always on the lookout for other datasets. Please feel free to

                    rank</span> of the <span class="emphasized-but-not-that-emphasized">characters</span> in the
                sentence is shown, with
                emojis indicating how common (🔥🔥🔥) or uncommon (🥶🥶🥶) the average is. More emojis means a more
                extreme
                average, whether more common or more rare. The emoji counts were based on analysis of the distribution
                of the averages across all sentences. The idea is to indicate how difficult a sentence is likely to be.

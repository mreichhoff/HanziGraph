    <p>This site is a prototype, but it&#39;s decently usable in its current state. Feel free to see the (currently at a hackathon level of quality) <a href="https://github.com/mreichhoff/HanziGraph">code</a> or contact <a href="https://github.com/mreichhoff">the author on github</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Where did the examples come from?
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The examples came from <a href="https://tatoeba.org">Tatoeba</a>, which releases data under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/fr">CC-BY 2.0 FR</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>Definitions and pinyin transcriptions of individual words were pulled from <a href="https://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php">CEDICT</a>, which releases data under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.

    <h2 id="explore-mode">Explore Mode</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why doesn&#39;t this look good on my smartphone?
	<ul>
	  <li>The site is currently meant to be viewed on larger screens. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>What if two hanzi can be connected more than one way, like 故事 and 事故?
	<ul>
	  <li>Clicking the edge that connects them will show examples for both words.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="study-mode">Study Mode</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How does this work?
	<ul>
	  <li>When you add words to your study list, they will be presented to you as flashcards. You&#39;ll be shown the sentence and asked what it means; click &quot;Show Answer&quot; to see how tatoeba translated it. When you click &quot;I didn&#39;t know that&quot;, the card will be asked again in 15 minutes. When you click &quot;I knew that!&quot;, it will be shown one day later, then two days if you get it right again, then four, and so on. It is meant to be a very, very basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>What does the export button do?
	<ul>
	  <li>The export button downloads a file that can be imported into a different (better) spaced repetition system, like Anki.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>What happens when I click a hanzi in study mode?
	<ul>
	  <li>The graph will be updated to show the hanzi you clicked and its connections. The explore panel is also updated. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>What happens when I click an edge in study mode?
	<ul>
	  <li>If you click an edge, the examples are updated and you&#39;ll be brought back to the explore tab.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Where are the flashcards stored?
	<ul>
	  <li>All data for the site is currently stored in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>. It does not leave your browser, and clearing your browser data will remove it. A future version could add cross-device syncing.</li>
